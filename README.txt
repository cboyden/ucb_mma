PURPOSE
-------

Mixed Mode Authentication (mma) facilitates allowing users multiple
authentication mechanisms to login to a site.  They can either use
Drupal's standard authentication or a different mechanism like
CAS. The module alters the registration form and the login form to
present sauthentication options.  The module sets a cookie to
facilitate keeping the user in just one "authentication channel" or
the other.
