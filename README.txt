PURPOSE
-------

Mixed Mode Authentication (mma) facilitates allowing users multiple
authentication mechanisms to login to a site.  They can either use
Drupal's standard authentication or a different mechanism like
CAS. The module alters the registration form and the login form to
present sauthentication options.  The module sets a cookie to
facilitate keeping the user in just one "authentication channel" or
the other.

Branches
--------

The drupal.org git strategy is not to use the master branch.  Click on
the github Branches tab to get to the 6.x and 7.x branches. The
READMEs on the branches are a lot more entertaining.
